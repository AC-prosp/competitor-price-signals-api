# Competitor Price Monitoring API

Track competitor price and product changes in real time and trigger automated actions.

Set up in under 60 seconds. No scraping setup required.

---

## What this does

Competitors change prices, stock, and products constantly. If you react too late, you lose revenue.

This API monitors product pages and detects meaningful changes such as:

- Price drops and increases
- Stock availability changes
- Product updates

It returns structured data and can trigger webhooks so your systems can react instantly.
